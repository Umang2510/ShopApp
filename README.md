# ShopApp
An E-commerce app in flutter.

An app which shows how State management concept works in flutter and how this solves the problem also we work with user input, forms, authentication and https request.

Here we mainly focus on working app and not on UI, I know that UI is not that much eye catching, So you can change UI as per your choice.

models - Contains dart classes and structure of data.
Screens - Contains the different screens of app.
Widgets - Contains the widgets which displayed on the screens. 
providers - Contains the providers for data sharing and state management.

>> Recently I tried to build apk of this file And got many errors. So, if you are using this repo then you have to migrate to a newer version of Flutter. I tried many things based on knowledge but nothing worked. If you have solution then let me know. [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/umang2510)
